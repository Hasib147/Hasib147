### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Hasib147/Hasib147** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Tentative Stages of the Project: (as discussed in the approach section in module 2)

•	Step 1: Import the dataset from Kaggle
-	In this step, I took the data for Walmart Sales Forecasting and imported it onto RStudio.

•	Step 2: Data Processing/Extraction
-	In this step, I took the data and observed the different types of variables it had and sorted it accordingly (i.e. numeric or categorical)

•	Step 3: Data Cleaning
-	In this step, it was to see whether different type of attributes needed to be added/removed, in this case I kept most of it as is.

•	Step 4: Test/Train Model
-	This step was used to split the data, I used the 70% training and 30% testing criteria to evaluate the dataset, this narrowed the dataset from over 400,000 rows into 294,000 rows for training and 126,000 rows for testing for better accuracy of the model.

•	Step 5: Build a multiple linear regression model

-	I used the weekly sales as the target variable and used it as dependent variable and the other attributes such as temperature, fuel price and CPI as the independent variable

•	Step 6: Result and Discussion

-	This is the part where I analyze the different types of results within the data such as boxplots, scatter plot, pie chart, etc. along with the summary table to see different types of results (ie max, median, min, etc.) and see if any outliers are there and if they have an impact of the sales forecasting

•	Step 7: Conclusion

-	This is the final part of the approach and it’s based on the evidence from the data and the results obtained through the regression model and other factors.
